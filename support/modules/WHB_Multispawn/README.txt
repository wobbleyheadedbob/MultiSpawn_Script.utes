[WHB] FOB Respawn : Forward Operations Base Respawn Script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script allows a player to setup multiple forward bases which can be used as respawn 
points. To try an break away from this just being another respawn script, the attempt is 
to make things a little tougher on the player. There is no teleportation or respawn selection 
menu, to respawn at a delpoyed FOB you will first need to travel there and "Sign In".
